Security (Go Full OAuth2)

Adopt full OAuth2 using a standard provider/library (e.g., Auth0, Keycloak, OAuthlib).

Access Token: short-lived JWT (5–15 minutes).

Refresh Token: long-lived, used to obtain new access tokens.

Implement revocation, rotation, scopes/roles/permissions, and (if applicable) user consent flows.

Maintain audit logs for token events (issuance, rotation, revocation, failed refresh).

Inventory & Categories — Professional Enhancements

Keep unlimited nested subcategories.

Add attributes & tags (e.g., “Material: Gold”, “Size: Large”, “Vendor: X”) for filtering/searching and reporting.

Add unique identifiers for every item (SKU/Barcode/QR) to support large-scale operations and fast lookups.

Ensure attributes are schema-driven (define attribute types: text/number/date/enum) and assignable per category.

Invoice Logic — Professional Enhancements

Keep auto inventory deduction on invoice create and automatic restore on invoice delete/void.

Keep manual price entry, but add:

Default pricing with override: invoice pre-fills item price from inventory; user can override.

Cost vs. Sale Price tracking: store both for margin/profit analytics.

Support draft → approved workflow (optional): only approved invoices affect stock and accounting.

Gold-Specific Invoices (سود و اجرت)

Continue conditional fields for gold invoices: سود and اجرت appear only when invoice type = Gold.

Display these fields on the invoice, and keep final price entered manually.

Also store سود & اجرت as separate accounting values so they appear in journals/reports (not just on the printed invoice).

Accounting Expansion — Professional Enhancements

Implement/ensure double-entry accounting: every business event posts balanced debit/credit lines.

Include:

حساب‌های تفصیلی و دفتر معین

مدیریت کامل چک‌ها و حساب‌ها و تاریخ معاملات

بهبود حساب‌های اقساطی و ...

Add reconciliation features (match invoices with checks/bank deposits).

Ensure multi-period closing/locking and edit history/audit trail for all postings.

Comprehensive Testing — Professional Enhancements

Create end-to-end tests for all tabs, sub-tabs, sub-sections, and routes covering calculations and side effects.

Add automated test coverage reports (e.g., pytest + coverage) with target thresholds.

Add load tests for invoices & accounting (simulate ≥100 concurrent users).

Include regression test suites for inventory movements, pricing overrides, and gold-specific logic.
