# Invoice Form Text Visibility Improvements

## Issue Addressed
The enhanced invoice form had beautiful glassy effects but text visibility was poor due to low contrast between text colors and the translucent backgrounds.

## Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Card Backgrounds
**Before:** Light gradient backgrounds with low opacity
**After:** Added backdrop blur and better opacity balance

```css
/* Before */
bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-50 to-indigo-100/50

/* After */
bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-50/80 to-indigo-100/60 backdrop-blur-sm border border-blue-200/30
```

### 2. Improved Text Contrast
**Before:** Light gray text colors (text-gray-600, text-blue-800)
**After:** Darker, more readable colors (text-slate-700, text-blue-900)

#### Text Color Changes:
- **Labels:** `text-gray-600` → `text-slate-700 font-medium`
- **Values:** `font-medium` → `font-semibold text-slate-900`
- **Card Titles:** `text-blue-800` → `text-blue-900 font-semibold`

### 3. Enhanced Tab Navigation
**Improvements:**
- Added background to tab list: `bg-gradient-to-r from-slate-50/80 to-slate-100/60 backdrop-blur-sm`
- Better text contrast for inactive tabs: `text-slate-700 hover:text-slate-900`
- Improved active tab colors: `data-[state=active]:text-blue-900`

### 4. Customer Information Panel
**Before:** `bg-gray-50` with `text-gray-600`
**After:** `bg-white/60 backdrop-blur-sm border border-blue-200/40` with `text-slate-700 font-medium`

### 5. Advanced Pricing Section

### 7. Calculation Summary
**Improvements:**

### 8. Sticky Action Bar
**Enhancement:** Added backdrop blur for modern glassy effect while maintaining readability
`bg-white/95 backdrop-blur-sm border-t border-slate-200/50`

## Technical Implementation

### Color Palette Strategy
- **Primary Text:** `text-slate-900` (highest contrast)
- **Secondary Text:** `text-slate-700` (medium contrast)
- **Card Titles:** Color-specific dark variants (`text-blue-900`, `text-emerald-900`, etc.)
