# Enhanced Invoice System with Flexible Workflows - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented Task 4 "Enhanced Invoice System with Flexible Workflows" from the Universal Business Platform specification. This implementation provides a comprehensive invoice management system with workflow engine, approval system, multiple payment methods, and business type specific features while maintaining full backward compatibility with the existing gold shop system.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Flexible Invoice Workflow Engine
- **Workflow Definition System**: Configurable workflows per business type with stages (draft → approval → stock impact)
- **Workflow Transitions**: Controlled transitions between stages with validation and business rules
- **Approval System**: Role-based approval requirements with configurable thresholds
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive tracking of all workflow transitions and changes

### 2. Enhanced Pricing Engine
- **Gold Shop Pricing**: Specialized calculations with سود (profit) and اجرت (labor cost) support
- **Standard Business Pricing**: Universal pricing for retail, service, and other business types
- **Cost vs Sale Price Tracking**: Comprehensive margin and profit analytics
- **Multiple Tax Rates**: Support for complex tax calculations and discount formulas

### 3. Multiple Payment Method Support
- **Payment Method Management**: Support for cash, card, bank transfer, and digital payments
- **Partial Payment Tracking**: Handle multiple payments against single invoices
- **Payment Workflow Integration**: Automatic workflow transitions based on payment status
- **Accounting Integration**: Automatic creation of accounting entries for payments

### 4. Business Type Specific Features
- **Gold Shop Compatibility**: Full preservation of existing gold shop features (سود and اجرت)
- **Universal Business Support**: Adaptable to retail, service, manufacturing, and other business types
- **Conditional Field Display**: Business type specific fields shown only when relevant
- **Terminology Mapping**: Industry-specific language adaptation

### 5. Inventory Integration
- **Automatic Stock Impact**: Stock deduction on invoice approval and restoration on void
- **Stock Validation**: Real-time stock availability checking during invoice creation
- **Inventory Movement Tracking**: Comprehensive audit trail of stock changes
- **Multi-Unit Support**: Handle different units of measure and conversion factors

### 6. Comprehensive Audit Trail
- **Invoice Changes**: Track all modifications to invoices with user attribution
- **Workflow Transitions**: Log all stage changes with timestamps and reasons
- **Payment History**: Complete payment tracking with method and reference details
- **Stock Movements**: Detailed inventory movement records linked to invoices

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

#### 1. InvoiceService (`backend/services/invoice_service.py`)
- Main service class orchestrating all invoice operations
- Handles invoice creation, workflow management, and payment processing
- Provides backward compatibility with existing database schema

#### 2. InvoiceWorkflowEngine
- Manages workflow definitions and transitions
- Validates business rules and approval requirements
- Handles stage-specific logic (stock impact, accounting entries)

#### 3. InvoicePricingEngine
- Calculates pricing for different business types
- Supports gold-specific calculations (weight-based pricing with سود and اجرت)
- Handles standard business pricing with discounts and taxes

#### 4. Enhanced Schemas (`backend/schemas_invoice_universal.py`)
- Comprehensive Pydantic models for all invoice operations
- Support for multiple business types and workflow stages
- Flexible payment method and audit trail schemas

#### 5. Universal Router (`backend/routers/invoices_universal.py`)
- RESTful API endpoints for all invoice operations
- Workflow transition endpoints with validation
- Comprehensive filtering and search capabilities
- Analytics and reporting endpoints

### Database Compatibility

The implementation provides full backward compatibility with the existing database schema while adding support for universal features:

- **Existing Models**: Works with current `Invoice`, `InvoiceItem`, `Customer`, `InventoryItem` models
- **Universal Fields**: Gracefully handles new fields when available (workflow_stage, business_type_fields)
- **JSON Serialization**: Proper handling of UUID and Decimal types in JSONB fields
- **Field Mapping**: Supports both old (`purchase_price`) and new (`cost_price`) field naming conventions

## Testing Coverage
