# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the critical internationalization issues in the gold shop management system. Currently, the application has mixed languages (English and Persian text appearing together), inconsistent RTL/LTR styling, and incomplete translation coverage across all pages, components, charts, and UI elements. This solution will focus exclusively on translation completeness and RTL/LTR styling fixes without modifying the existing UI components or backend functionality.
