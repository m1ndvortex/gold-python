# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for transforming the existing gold shop management system into a Universal Business Management Platform. The system will evolve from a gold-specific application to a comprehensive, industry-agnostic business management solution that can serve any type of business while maintaining all existing functionality for gold shops. The platform will feature full OAuth2 security, professional inventory management with unlimited nested categories, enhanced invoicing with flexible workflows, comprehensive double-entry accounting, and enterprise-grade testing coverage.

The transformation maintains backward compatibility with existing gold shop features while adding universal business capabilities, making it suitable for retail stores, service businesses, manufacturing, wholesale operations, and any other business type.
