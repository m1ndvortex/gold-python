# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a professional ÿ∑ŸÑÿßŸÅÿ±Ÿàÿ¥€å (gold shop) web application. The system will be a full-featured, modern web application built with React + TypeScript + shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS frontend and FastAPI + PostgreSQL backend. The application will run fully in Docker environment and serve as a comprehensive business management solution for gold shops, supporting both Persian (RTL) and English languages.

**üê≥ CRITICAL DOCKER ENVIRONMENT REMINDER:** 
- This entire application runs in Docker containers
- ALL development, testing, and deployment MUST assume Docker environment
- NO testing or execution should occur outside of Docker containers
- ALL unit tests MUST use real PostgreSQL database within Docker
- This is a production-ready application requiring real database testing

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT FOR ALL TASKS:** Every task implementation must include unit tests using the real PostgreSQL database running in Docker. Never mock the database or test outside the Docker environment.
