# System Fixes 2025 - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for systematically fixing critical issues in the Universal Business Management Platform. The system currently has multiple broken components including OAuth2 authentication failures, non-functional inventory management, broken invoice creation, missing analytics UI, accounting system errors, outdated tests, and hardcoded system information. 

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: For every backend feature that needs UI, we must implement and integrate the UI components into the current interface so users can see and use the changes immediately.

The specific issues to address:
- OAuth2 system has compilation errors and Bearer token issues
- Enhanced inventory system exists but old system is still being used - need professional enterprise-level category management with infinite nesting
- Enhanced invoice system exists but "Create Invoice" button is not working
- Advanced Analytics and Business Intelligence backend is implemented but not visible in UI
- Accounting system tabs are stuck loading with errors - Double-Entry Accounting Frontend Interface is implemented but not accessible in UI
- All tests are outdated and need complete rewrite with real database and API integration
- Invoice, accounting, report, and chart calculations need comprehensive testing with real data
- Disaster recovery and backup system needs 100% reliability improvements
- System overview in settings shows hardcoded data instead of real system information
- Need professional role-based access control system in settings

The goal is to transform the current partially-working system into a fully operational, enterprise-grade business management platform with all features working seamlessly together and accessible through the UI.
