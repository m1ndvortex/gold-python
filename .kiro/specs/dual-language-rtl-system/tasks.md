# Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan transforms the dual-language RTL system design into actionable coding tasks. Each task builds incrementally on previous work, focusing on systematic translation coverage, RTL layout implementation, and comprehensive testing with real APIs and databases.

All tasks must be executed in Docker containers with real backend services and authentication. After each task completion, run type-check and build validation commands.

## Task Execution Guidelines

### Docker Testing Requirements
- All tests must run in Docker containers using `docker-compose`
- Use real API endpoints and database connections - NO MOCKING
- Authenticate with actual authentication system when required
- Test with production-like data and scenarios

### Build Validation Commands
After completing each task, run these commands and fix any errors:
```bash
docker-compose exec frontend npm run type-check
docker-compose exec frontend npm run build
```

### Task Dependencies
- Tasks must be completed in sequential order
- Each task builds on the previous task's implementation
- Do not proceed to the next task until the current task is fully complete and validated
- Sub-tasks within a main task should be completed before moving to the next main task

### Success Criteria
- All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- All build processes complete successfully
- All tests pass with real API and database connections
- No mixed language content visible in either language mode
- RTL/LTR layouts work correctly for all components
- All calculations produce identical results in both languages
