# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements comprehensive dual-language support for the gold shop management system, providing complete English and Persian language support with proper RTL (Right-to-Left) layout for Persian and LTR (Left-to-Right) layout for English. The system will ensure all text content is properly translated, all UI components adapt to the selected language direction, and all calculations and data processing work correctly in both languages.

The implementation will audit all existing pages, components, forms, buttons, and API responses to identify missing translations, implement proper directional layouts, and validate that all business logic calculations work correctly across both language contexts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Translation Coverage

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the application completely in my selected language (English or Persian) without any mixed language content, so that I can use the system comfortably in my preferred language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects English language THEN the system SHALL display all UI text, labels, buttons, forms, error messages, and notifications in English only
2. WHEN a user selects Persian language THEN the system SHALL display all UI text, labels, buttons, forms, error messages, and notifications in Persian only
3. WHEN the system loads any page THEN it SHALL NOT display mixed language content (English text in Persian mode or Persian text in English mode)
4. WHEN API responses are returned THEN they SHALL include translated content appropriate to the user's selected language
5. WHEN form validation errors occur THEN they SHALL be displayed in the user's selected language
6. WHEN the system displays dates, numbers, and currency THEN they SHALL be formatted according to the selected language's locale conventions

### Requirement 2: Comprehensive Page and Component Audit

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to systematically identify all pages, routes, components, and API endpoints that need translation support, so that no content is missed in the translation implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conducting the audit THEN the system SHALL identify all page routes and their associated components
2. WHEN auditing components THEN the system SHALL catalog all tabs, sub-tabs, sections, buttons, forms, labels, and text content

4. WHEN analyzing the codebase THEN the system SHALL create a comprehensive inventory of all translatable strings
5. WHEN documenting findings THEN the system SHALL categorize content by page, component type, and translation priority
6. WHEN identifying missing translations THEN the system SHALL provide specific file locations and line numbers for each untranslated string

### Requirement 3: RTL/LTR Layout Implementation

**User Story:** As a Persian-speaking user, I want the entire application layout to be right-to-left oriented when I select Persian language, so that the interface feels natural and intuitive for my reading direction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Persian language is selected THEN the entire application layout SHALL switch to RTL (Right-to-Left) orientation
2. WHEN English language is selected THEN the entire application layout SHALL use LTR (Left-to-Right) orientation

4. WHEN in RTL mode THEN all navigation menus, dropdowns, and modal dialogs SHALL be right-aligned
5. WHEN in RTL mode THEN text input fields SHALL have right-aligned text entry and right-aligned labels
6. WHEN in RTL mode THEN data tables SHALL have columns arranged from right to left with appropriate header alignment
7. WHEN in RTL mode THEN charts and graphs SHALL maintain proper readability with RTL-appropriate legends and labels
8. WHEN switching between languages THEN the layout transition SHALL be smooth and immediate without requiring page refresh

### Requirement 4: Chart and Data Visualization RTL Support

**User Story:** As a Persian-speaking user, I want all charts, graphs, and data visualizations to be properly oriented and labeled in Persian with RTL layout, so that I can easily interpret the data in my preferred language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing charts in Persian mode THEN all chart titles, axis labels, and legends SHALL be displayed in Persian
2. WHEN viewing charts in RTL mode THEN chart legends SHALL be positioned appropriately for RTL reading
3. WHEN displaying data tables in RTL mode THEN column headers and data SHALL be right-aligned where appropriate
4. WHEN showing numerical data in Persian mode THEN numbers SHALL be formatted according to Persian locale conventions
5. WHEN displaying dates in charts THEN they SHALL use the appropriate calendar system and formatting for the selected language
6. WHEN chart tooltips appear THEN they SHALL be displayed in the selected language with proper RTL/LTR alignment

### Requirement 5: Calculation and Business Logic Validation

**User Story:** As a business user, I want all calculations, accounting operations, invoice processing, and installment system calculations to work correctly regardless of the selected language, so that the business operations remain accurate and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing accounting calculations THEN the results SHALL be identical regardless of the selected language
2. WHEN processing invoices THEN all calculations (subtotals, taxes, discounts, totals) SHALL be accurate in both language modes
3. WHEN using the installment system (سیستم اقساتی) THEN payment calculations SHALL be correct in both English and Persian modes
4. WHEN generating reports THEN numerical data and calculations SHALL be consistent across both languages
5. WHEN processing inventory operations THEN stock calculations and valuations SHALL be accurate regardless of language
6. WHEN handling currency conversions THEN the calculations SHALL use the same exchange rates and formulas in both languages
7. WHEN displaying financial summaries THEN totals and balances SHALL match exactly between English and Persian views

### Requirement 6: Authentication and User Session Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want my language preference to be remembered across sessions and properly integrated with the authentication system, so that I don't have to reselect my language every time I use the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL remember their previously selected language preference
2. WHEN a user changes language preference THEN it SHALL be saved to their user profile
3. WHEN authentication is required for testing THEN the test framework SHALL properly authenticate users for both language contexts
4. WHEN API calls are made THEN they SHALL include the user's language preference in request headers
5. WHEN user sessions expire THEN the language preference SHALL be maintained after re-authentication
6. WHEN new users register THEN they SHALL be able to select their preferred language during the registration process

### Requirement 7: Comprehensive Testing Framework

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive automated tests that validate translation completeness, RTL/LTR functionality, and calculation accuracy using real APIs and databases, so that I can ensure the dual-language system works correctly in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running translation tests THEN they SHALL use real API endpoints and database connections without any mocking
2. WHEN testing RTL/LTR layouts THEN the tests SHALL verify actual DOM element positioning and CSS properties
3. WHEN validating calculations THEN the tests SHALL use real backend services and database operations

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any translation task is completed THEN the system SHALL run `docker-compose exec frontend npm run type-check` successfully
2. WHEN any translation task is completed THEN the system SHALL run `docker-compose exec frontend npm run build` successfully

2. WHEN changing from LTR to RTL THEN the layout SHALL update smoothly without visual glitches
3. WHEN loading pages in either language THEN the initial render time SHALL not be significantly different
4. WHEN using the application in RTL mode THEN the performance SHALL be equivalent to LTR mode
5. WHEN translation resources are loaded THEN they SHALL be cached appropriately to minimize network requests
6. WHEN the application starts THEN the default language SHALL be determined and applied before the first render

### Requirement 10: Error Handling and Fallback Mechanisms

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to gracefully handle missing translations or RTL/LTR rendering issues, so that I can continue using the system even if some translations are incomplete.

#### Acceptance Criteria
