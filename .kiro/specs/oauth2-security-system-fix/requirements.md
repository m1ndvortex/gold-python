# OAuth2 Security System Fix - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fixing the OAuth2 authentication and security system in the Universal Business Management Platform. The current OAuth2 implementation has critical issues including compilation errors, Bearer token problems, broken authentication middleware, non-functional dashboard and sidebar components, missing role-based access control, and poor token management. 

The system needs a robust, fast, secure, and simple OAuth2 implementation that works seamlessly with all existing components including dashboard, sidebar, charts, routes, and every part of the application. The solution must include a better token system that is not overly complicated but provides enterprise-grade security with proper role and permission management.
