# Enhanced Invoice System Migration Summary

## Issue Resolved
The invoice system was still using the old `InvoiceForm` component instead of the new `EnhancedInvoiceForm` that was implemented as part of Task 11 (Enhanced Invoice Management Frontend Interface).

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Main Invoice Page
**File:** `frontend/src/pages/Invoices.tsx`
- **Changed:** Import statement from `InvoiceForm` to `EnhancedInvoiceForm`
- **Changed:** Component usage to use `EnhancedInvoiceForm` with enhanced props
- **Added:** `mode` prop to distinguish between 'create' and 'edit' modes
- **Result:** The main invoice page now uses the enhanced form with all new features

### 2. Updated Test Files
**Files Updated:**
- `frontend/src/tests/invoice-production.test.tsx`
- `frontend/src/tests/invoice-gradient-styling.test.tsx`
- `frontend/src/tests/invoice-docker.test.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Updated import statements to use `EnhancedInvoiceForm`
- Updated component references in test descriptions and test cases
- Ensured all tests use the new enhanced form component

### 3. Removed Legacy Component
**File Removed:** `frontend/src/components/invoices/InvoiceForm.tsx`
- **Reason:** No longer needed as all references have been migrated to `EnhancedInvoiceForm`
- **Safety:** Verified no remaining references before removal
