## Integration Architecture

### Data Flow
```
User Input → Component → API Service → Backend → Database
                ↓
         Real-time Updates ← WebSocket ← Event System
```

### API Integration
All components use the `accountingApi` service for:
- RESTful API calls
- Error handling
- Authentication
- Data validation
- Response formatting

### State Management
- React hooks for local state
- React Query for server state
- Context providers for shared data
- Real-time updates via WebSocket

## Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Component interaction with APIs
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete user workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Load and stress testing
- **Security Tests**: Authentication and authorization

### Real Database Testing
All tests use real PostgreSQL databases in Docker:
- No mocking of database operations
- Actual API calls to backend services
- Real data validation and integrity checks
- Performance testing under load

### Test Files
- `double-entry-accounting-interface.test.tsx`: Individual component tests
- `comprehensive-double-entry-accounting.test.tsx`: Full integration tests
- `run-accounting-tests.sh/ps1`: Test execution scripts

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Journal Entry
```typescript
const journalEntry = {
  entry_date: '2024-01-15',
  description: 'Sales transaction',
  reference: 'INV-001',
  lines: [
    {
      account_id: 'cash-account-id',
      debit_amount: 1000,
      credit_amount: 0,
      description: 'Cash received'
    },
    {
      account_id: 'revenue-account-id',
      debit_amount: 0,
      credit_amount: 1000,
      description: 'Sales revenue'
    }
  ]
};

await accountingApi.createJournalEntry(journalEntry);
```

### Generating Financial Reports
```typescript
// Trial Balance
const trialBalance = await accountingApi.getTrialBalance('2024-01-31');

// Balance Sheet
const balanceSheet = await accountingApi.getBalanceSheet('2024-01-31');

// Income Statement
const incomeStatement = await accountingApi.getIncomeStatement(
  '2024-01-01', 
  '2024-01-31'
);
```

### Bank Reconciliation
```typescript
const reconciliation = {
  bank_account_id: 'bank-account-id',
  reconciliation_date: '2024-01-31',
  statement_balance: 10000,
  book_balance: 9800,
  outstanding_deposits: 500,
  outstanding_checks: 300,
  bank_charges: 25,
  interest_earned: 5
};

await accountingApi.createBankReconciliation(reconciliation);
```
